# date_night
This was my first project at Turing. The task was to build a binary tree data structure from scratch with functions that allowed us to traverse the tree, add data, remove data, and provide information about the tree. The assignment can be found here: http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night

## Setup
Functionality is very basic and there is no CLI, However a full test suite was written for the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/Maxscores/date_night.git
cd date_night
ruby tests/tree_test.rb
ruby tests/node_test.rb
```
